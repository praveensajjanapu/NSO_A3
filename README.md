As part of this assignment, I wrote a script to probe an SNMP agent and calculated the rate of change for several OIDs between successive samples. The script handles both 32- and 64-bit  COUNTER OIDs, addressing issues like counter wraps and SNMP agent restarts. It must maintains the specified sampling frequency (0.1 to 10 Hz) even during timeouts. The script will take agent details (IP, port, community), sample frequency, number of samples, and the OIDs to probe as input. The output displays the timestamp and rate of change for each OID. If the agent resets, the script should log the reset and continue sampling correctly.
